					<h2>Albania</h2>
					<p>Albania is a beautiful counry with a lot of beautiful beaches and mountains. We are a people very proud of our origin and blood. Our culture has developed across the years to be very familiar and loving with the people close to us. We also foster a hard work ethic.</p>

					<h2>Swimming</h2>
					<p>From a very young age the doctors believed I had asma and told me to start swimming as to help grow my lungs and "cure" my asma. It turned out that I didnt have asma yet I still pursued swimming for 12 years at a professional level where I won international competitions across Europe

					<h2>My gap year</h2>
					<p>I was lucky enough to complete my high school education one year in advance. To make the most of this oppurtunity, I worked for a year in finance. In this experience I learned the ins and outs of being a financial consultant as well as making many good connections for the future. This helped me build my path and prepare myself for the future.</p>
